1. Installations

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

2. Project Motivation

The aim of the project is to investigate factors that positive and negatively affects revenue generation from movie production. Hence, the following questions were considered:

a. What is the association between movies with tagline and revenue/adjusted revenue(renvenue_adj)
b. What decade are the most popular movies released; how much revenue was recorded that year?
c. Does higher vote count have any influence on revenue generated?

3. File Description
For this project, I chose a dataset of my own, which is the TMDb movie dataset. This data set contains information over 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The database has 10866 rows and 21 columns. The columns include: Id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tangline, overview, runtime, genre, production_company, release_date, vote_count, vote_average, release_year, budject_adj, and revenue_adj.
There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.

4. Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available in the link below:
